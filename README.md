# Libraries 

## Backened

----

### Node.js

A Framework that allows javascript to run in a desktop environment

I chose node because of it's popularity (so it has a lot of packages) and that I already know javascript so it's quite easy to learn

### Express.js

A Library that makes creating a web server a lot easier. 

I chose this because it speeds up the development process and there was no need for something more optimised. Another advantage is that it's very popular thus well documented

### jQuery

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

I chose to use jQuery because it makes interacting with the DOM a lot easier, it also includes some animations

### PageDown

PageDown is a popular javascript library for working with markdown. It includes a converter and an editor.

All notes are formatted with markdown

I chose this because it's easy to work with, and it is used by popular sites such as StackExchange
